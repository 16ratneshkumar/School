A mixture contains particles of two or more
pure substances which may be present in it in
any ratio. Hence, their composition is variable.
Pure sustances forming mixture are called its
components. Many of the substances present
around you are mixtures. For example, sugar
solution in water, air, tea, etc., are all mixtures.
A mixture may be homogeneous or
heterogeneous. In a homogeneous mixture,
the components completely mix with each other.
This means particles of components of the
mixture are uniformly distributed throughout

Fig. 1.1 Arrangement of particles in solid, liquid
and gaseous state
the bulk of the mixture and its composition is
uniform throughout. Sugar solution and air
are the examples of homogeneous mixtures.
In contrast to this, in a heterogeneous
throughout and sometimes different
components are visible. For example, mixtures
of salt and sugar, grains and pulses along with
some dirt (often stone pieces), are
heterogeneous mixtures. You can think of
many more examples of mixtures which you
come across in the daily life. It is worthwhile to
mention here that the components of a
mixture can be separated by using physical
methods, such as simple
hand-picking, filtration, crystallisation,
distillation, etc.
